# 3D FPS Game / Engine

A fast, lightweight 3D first-person shooter game engine written in C. <br/>
Build classic FPS maps using [TrenchBroom](https://trenchbroom.github.io/), and run them with modern OpenGL rendering powered by [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/). <br/>
Check out my Blog post about this repo: [3D Game Development in C](https://skyelynwaddell.github.io/fps-engine-c/)

## Features

* 💻 Written in C
* 🛠️ Map editing support via TrenchBroom
* 🖼️ Uses OpenGL for cross-platform 3D rendering
* 🎮 Game engine graphics library/core using raylib and raygui

## Build Instructions

### 🪟 Windows

```bash
./build.bat
```

### 🍎 macOS

```bash
sudo ./buildmac.sh
```

### 🐧 Linux

```bash
./build.sh
```
